Algorithm: Sentence Analysis

Objective:
- Calculate the length of a sentence (number of characters including the period).
- Count the number of words (words are separated by a single space).
- Count the number of vowels in the sentence.

Steps:
1. Initialize variables:
   - `length_counter` to 0 (to track the total number of characters).
   - `word_counter` to 0 (to count the number of words).
   - `vowel_counter` to 0 (to count the number of vowels).
   - `is_in_word` to false (to track whether we are inside a word).

2. Begin reading characters of the sentence one by one:
   - While the character is not a period (`.`):
     a. Increment `length_counter` by 1.
     b. If the character is a vowel (`a, e, i, o, u` or `A, E, I, O, U`):
        - Increment `vowel_counter` by 1.
     c. If the character is a space:
        - Check if `is_in_word` is true:
          - If true, increment `word_counter` by 1.
          - Set `is_in_word` to false.
     d. If the character is not a space:
        - Set `is_in_word` to true.

3. When the period (`.`) is encountered:
   - Increment `length_counter` by 1 (for the period).
   - If `is_in_word` is true:
     - Increment `word_counter` by 1 (to count the last word).

4. Output the results:
   - Print `length_counter` (total characters including the period).
   - Print `word_counter` (total number of words).
   - Print `vowel_counter` (total number of vowels).
